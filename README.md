# Credit Card Approval Predictions

## Project Overview
This project analyzes various statistical models to predict credit card approval decisions using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The study focuses on evaluating logistic, ridge, and lasso regression models to determine which is most effective in accurately predicting credit card approvals.

## Objective
To apply and compare different regression models in predicting credit card approval decisions and to identify the most significant variables affecting these decisions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and data cleaning.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilizes statistical summaries and visualization techniques to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
- **Model Implementation**: Logistic regression, ridge regression, and lasso regression are employed to predict credit card approvals.
- **Model Evaluation**: The models are evaluated based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC scores to assess their performance.

## Methodologies
### Data Preparation
- **Dataset**: Consists of 10,127 records with 23 attributes, including credit scores, income levels, age, and other relevant variables.
- **Cleaning**: Data is cleaned to handle any inconsistencies and prepare it for analysis.

### Statistical Modeling
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for its ability to predict binary outcomes, making it suitable for approval predictions.
- **Ridge and Lasso Regression**: These regularization methods are tested to address potential overfitting and to improve model generalizability.

### Evaluation Techniques
- **Confusion Matrix**: Helps in visualizing the performance of the prediction models.
- **ROC Curve**: Used to illustrate the diagnostic ability of the classifier.
- **Feature Importance**: Analyzes the significance of different variables in the models.

## Results
- The models' effectiveness is measured by their ability to correctly predict credit card approvals.
- Lasso regression was found to be the most effective, providing the highest accuracy and the lowest number of incorrect predictions.

## Discussion
- The findings offer insights into which customer attributes significantly influence credit card approval decisions.
- These insights can help financial institutions refine their approval processes and enhance their risk assessment protocols.

## Visual Insights
- Various plots and charts such as histograms, distribution plots, and correlation matrices are used to visualize the data and results.

## Conclusion
This study provides valuable insights into the application of logistic, ridge, and lasso regression models in predicting credit card approvals. Lasso regression emerged as the most effective model, offering potential strategies for financial institutions to enhance their decision-making processes.
